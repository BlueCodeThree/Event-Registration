# Event Registration Mini Project

An internal project where Carlie can learn the key technologies and approaches
used on the Blackbaud project. The goal is to build a roughly similar, but vastly _simpler_,
version of the Online Registrations product we are building for Blackbaud.

The strategies for how to make this work are described in [THE_PLAN.md](THE_PLAN.md),
so give that a read. Obviously nothing there is set in stone.

This is currently a _private_ repository since we may steal some of the Blackbaud
project code. Once we get to the end of the project we can make it a public
repository if that seems appropriate.
