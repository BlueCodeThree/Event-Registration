# The Plan

## Milestones

We've created [milestones](https://github.com/stacktracehq/event-reg-mini-project/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open)
that represent some set of functionality the product should have.
Milestones will start with fairly high-level requirements that Carlie
and Brad will flesh out together as needed, in a sprint-planning/grooming style.

Milestones have _deadlines_ (though scope is extremely flexible) at which
point progress will be demonstrated to the team.

## Work Management and Visibility

We'll aim to keep everything relevant to the project
located in this GitHub repository, and it's related issues/[project board](https://github.com/stacktracehq/event-reg-mini-project/projects/2).
This will keep everything visible to the wider team.

We are also collating a [master list of relevant learning topics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1phvKv4pBP71SL5qE1G2XPI--kCuHnqZhpLwqUdbdiBE/edit#gid=643314494)
which will mostly serve as a reference for Brad to use when thinking about
how to guide the project work so as to maximise the number of topics covered.

Carlie will also track her forecasted and actual hours in that spreadsheet.

## Deep Dives

As Carlie works toward the project goals, we'll get an idea of specific
technical areas to focus our teaching effort/resources on. These things can
result in 'deep dives' into certain topics (e.g. Linq, ngrx etc.).

A lot of self-direction will be encouraged here, but where dedicated teaching
is required this workload can be spread amongst the Engineering team. This is
a good way for the wider team to get to work with Carlie, and exposes her to different
opinions and styles.

## Dedicated Contact Hours

It will probably prove beneficial to have some explicit commitments around
available contact/work hours. We'll start with something like:

### Brad's Time Commitments

* Brad will be available for a quick 1/2 hour catch up every day that both Brad and
Carlie are in these office.
* Brad will be available for an extended 'office hours' type session at 2
designated times throughout the week. These sessions can be utilized for
project level guidance/planning or technical deep dives/assistance.

### Other Team Member's Time Commitments

Other team members will be available from time to time for the 'deep dives'
mentioned above. We will also share PRs for this project amongst the ohter
Stacktrace engineers where appropriate.

### Carlie's Time Commitments

As per spreadsheet linked above.
