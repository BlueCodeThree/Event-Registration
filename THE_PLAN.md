# The Plan

## Milestones

We'll create _milestones_ that represent some set of functionality the
product should have. Milestones will start with fairly high-level requirements
that Carlie and Brad will flesh out together as needed, in a sprint-planning/grooming
style. We'll use the attached [Project Board](https://github.com/stacktracehq/event-reg-mini-project/projects/2)
to track currently active work, and provide visibility to the wider team.

Milestones will have _deadlines_ (though scope is extremely flexible) at which
point progress will be demonstrated to the team. We'll aim for monthly
deadlines, so probably 4 milestones between September 2019 and January 2020.

## Deep Dives

As Carlie works toward the project goals, we'll get idea of specific
technical areas to focus our teaching effort/resources on. These things can
result in 'deep dives' into certain topics (e.g. Linq, ngrx etc.).

A lot of self-direction will be encouraged here, but where dedicated teaching
is required this workload can be spread amongst the Engineering team. This is
a good way for the wider team to get to work with Carlie, and exposes her to different
opinions and styles.

## Dedicated Contact Hours

* Brad will be available for a quick 1/2 hour catch up every day that both Brad and
Carlie are in the office.
* Brad will be available for an extended 'office hours' type session at 2
designated times throughout the week (e.g. 3-5pm on Tuesdays and Thursday afternoons).
These sessions can be utilized for project level guidance/planning or technical
deep dives / assistance.
* Other team members will be available from time to time for the 'deep dives'
mentioned above. We'll try to spread this around.
