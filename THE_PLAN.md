# The Plan

## Milestones

We've created [milestones](https://github.com/stacktracehq/event-reg-mini-project/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open)
that represent some set of functionality the product should have.
Milestones will start with fairly high-level requirements that Carlie
and Brad will flesh out together as needed, in a sprint-planning/grooming style.

Milestones have _deadlines_ (though scope is extremely flexible) at which
point progress will be demonstrated to the team.

## Work Management and Visibility

We'll aim to keep everything relevant to the project, and Carlie's progress in
general, located in GitHub. There is a [project board](https://github.com/stacktracehq/event-reg-mini-project/projects/2)
to track currently active work. This will also help keep everything visible to
the wider team.

We are also collating a [master list of relevant learning topic](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1phvKv4pBP71SL5qE1G2XPI--kCuHnqZhpLwqUdbdiBE/edit#gid=643314494)
which will mostly serve as a reference for Brad to use when thinking about
how to guide the project work so as to maximise the number of topics covered.

## Deep Dives

As Carlie works toward the project goals, we'll get idea of specific
technical areas to focus our teaching effort/resources on. These things can
result in 'deep dives' into certain topics (e.g. Linq, ngrx etc.).

A lot of self-direction will be encouraged here, but where dedicated teaching
is required this workload can be spread amongst the Engineering team. This is
a good way for the wider team to get to work with Carlie, and exposes her to different
opinions and styles.

## Dedicated Contact Hours

It will probably prove beneficial to have some explicit commitments around
available contact/work hours. We'll start with something like:

### Brad's Time Commitments

* Brad will be available for a quick 1/2 hour catch up every day that both Brad and
Carlie are in these office. This is a commitment of around *2.5 hours/week*.
* Brad will be available for an extended 'office hours' type session at 2
designated times throughout the week (e.g. 3-5pm on Tuesdays and Thursday afternoons).
These sessions can be utilized for project level guidance/planning or technical
deep dives/assistance. This is a commitment of around *4 hours/week*
* Given these commitments, we should tentatively allow around *20% of Brad's* time
(~2.5 hours standups + ~4 hours office hours = ~6.5 hours = ~1 work day).
to be dedicated to guidance/mentoring.
* These time commitments may reduce over time.

### Other Team Member's Time Commitments

* Other team members will be available from time to time for the 'deep dives'
mentioned above. We'll try to spread this around.

### Carlie's Time Commitments
